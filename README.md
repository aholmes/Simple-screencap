Simple-screencap
================

Unsatisfied with Snipping Tool and its lack of a non-interactive mode, I put this together.

Now I can use my Apple keyboard to take screenshots on Windows!

Either run as-is, and you will be presented with a button to capture a new window screenshot, or run with the command-line option "-noWindow" to automatically take a screenshot.

Screenshots will save to your "My Pictures" directory.
