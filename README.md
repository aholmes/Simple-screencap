================

Unsatisfied with Snipping Tool and its lack of a non-interactive mode, I put this together.

Now I can use my Apple keyboard to take screenshots on Windows!

Either run as-is, and you will be presented with a button to capture a new window screenshot, or run with the following command-line options.

* `-noWindow` Automatically take a screenshot and save the file.
* `-jpeg` / `-jpg` / `-png` / `-bmp` / `-tiff` The saved screenshot image file format.
* `-window` / `-screen` / `-desktop` Capture either the current window, the current screen (single display), or your full desktop (multiple displays).


Screenshots will save to your "Pictures" directory.
